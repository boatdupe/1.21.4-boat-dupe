# 1.21.4-boat-dupe
this is a copy of the boat dupe that runs for 1.21.4, this comes with other plugins that will to stop chest boats from entering portals and stop duped items going through portals 
you will need a velocity proxy server (search tutorials on youtube) 
add your antiItemPortal PortalBoatBlocker and PortalBoatDupe to your papermc server plugin folder
next add the PortalBoatBlockerProxy to your velocity server plugin folder
start both and enjoy duping
NOTICE* you do not need the portalboatdupe-1.0.0.jar. this is if you dont want to use a proxy and just want the dupe ( this means you cant keep boats in portals they will go through without the proxy)
